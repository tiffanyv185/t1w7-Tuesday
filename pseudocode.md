# Pseudocode
- Plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or a program.
- A bridge between the program's logic and the actual code.

## Importance
- Helps to understand and plan the program logic, so its easier to code.
- improves collaborations in team projects
- Helps with troubleshooting
- Identifiy the core areas of the programming that needs to be done

## Characteristics
- Plain language: simple and understandable
- Structured: Follows a proper logic sequence
- Abstracted: Focuses on logic more than the syntax
- Detailed: Thorough walkthrough that helps explain the logic

## Basic Constructs:
- Sequential 
```
    Step 1: 
    Step 2:
```

- Conditional 
```
    IF condition THEN 
        Do something
    ELSE
        Do something else
    END IF
```

- Loops
```
    WHILE condition meets
        Do something
    END WHILE
```
```
    FOR EACH item in a collection
        DO something
    END FOR
```

## Practical Examples

- Example 1: Calculate the sum of a list of numbers
```
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Initialise the sum to 0
    For each number in the list
        ADD the number to sum
    END FOR
    Print sum
```

- Example 2: Finding the maximum number in a list
```
    Initialise max to the first number of the list
    FOR each number in the list
    IF number > than max THEN
        Set max to number
    END IF
```
